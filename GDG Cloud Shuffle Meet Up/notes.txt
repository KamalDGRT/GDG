Releases for server market in 2001
Popularizes virtual machines
Run many VMs on one physical machinne, meaninng you can buy fewer servers.

PaaS : Heroku [2009]
Building block is a buildpack, which enables containerized 12-factor applications.
Multiple applications in one VM.
Completes with AWS and VMWare

Docker [2013]
Cloud Native : CNCF [2015]
CN computing uses an open source software stack to 
 - segment applications into microservers
 - package each part innto its own container
 - and dynamically orchestrate those containers to optimize resource utilization

Initial name of Kubernetes : 

Avoid Vedor LockIn
Enable Unlimited Scalability
 - Scales from several nodes on ur laptop to
